# Data_Structures

It is an Implementation of some data structures which functionality is very similar to functionality of containers from STL. 
Goals of this project:
 - Understand the way STL containers, algorithms and iterators work;
 - practice memory management and template programming;
 - get acquaintance with Google's C++ test framework and write unit tests;
 - take a look at experienced developers who had implemented the same functionality and absorb good coding practices.

You will find implementation of containers in "DataStructuresTemplates/include" folder and tests for these containers in "DataStructuresTemplates/test" folder.
