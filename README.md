# Data_Structures

It is an implementation of a small library which functionality is very similar to functionality of STL.
Goals of this project:
 - Understand the way STL containers, algorithms and iterators work "under the hood";
 - practice memory management and template programming;
 - get acquaintance with Google's C++ test framework and write unit tests;

You will find implementation of containers in "DataStructuresTemplates/include" folder and tests for these containers in "DataStructuresTemplates/test" folder.
